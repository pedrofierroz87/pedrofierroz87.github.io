This study observes the role played by the pandemic in people’s digital political affection. By relying on a face-to-face survey conducted in Chile in 2021 (N=1,650), we found that those who changed their family communication habits were more likely to think that online venues facilitate fruitful political engagement (i.e. higher online political efficacy), and this relationship was stronger for those with positive evaluations of political institutions during the pandemic.
