Discontent is often captured through political voting patterns. Ballot votes represent one of the multiple manifestations of political discontent. We used a more comprehensive measure to capture the feeling of abandonment, known as external political efficacy (EPE), to measure people’s feelings about the responsiveness of the political system to their needs, and analyse individual and area-level factors underpinning individual variations in EPE. Key findings indicate that long-term territorial socio-economic disadvantage is a key predictor of individual-level discontent reflecting low levels of system responsiveness beliefs, rather than working in a low-paid occupation.
