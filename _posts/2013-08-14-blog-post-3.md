The efficient and equitable distribution of public goods and services can be susceptible to political manipulation. In this paper we analyse the electoral and political factors that impact the territorial allocation of public goods in Chile by identifying the gatekeepers that affect the process. Using spatial econometrics, we propose a political interpretation for W that enables us to identify the agent that is most decisive in the allocation of non-programmatic funds earmarked at the municipal level. The spatial analysis measurement of interaction is approximated through a neighbourhood matrix and if we define this “closeness” as belonging to a senatorial constituency, we can distinguish between direct (municipal level) and indirect (senatorial constituency level) allocation. Our results show that most municipal funds are due to an indirect effect, meaning senators (not mayors) have the greatest influence in the process. The political interpretation of W and the incorporation of spatial analysis into the model represent a twofold contribution to the literature on distributive politics and the identification of the gatekeepers in the territorial allocation of public funds in Chile.
