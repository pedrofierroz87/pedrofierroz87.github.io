This work analyses the Regional Development National Found (FNDR), the main initiative to face territorial equality and development in Chile. The analysis identifies three design problems. The first is related to the distribution criteria, which enhances fiscal centralism. The second is related to regional incentives. The evidence shows that the FNDR induce territorial fragmentation because it increases the relative percentage of assignment in the original territory. Finally, the third problem is related to intraregional incentives. The analysis shows that non-programmatic interregional transfers generate additional motivations for fragmentation because there is a privilege in the assignment to regional capitals and big cities before division. This work proposes orientation to improve the instrument design, seeking more consistency and facing the incentives to regional divisions.
