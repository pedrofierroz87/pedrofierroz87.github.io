title: "Wage Compensation for Fly‐In/Fly‐Out and Drive‐In/Drive‐Out Commuters"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The fly‐in/fly‐Out (FIFO) or, drive‐in/drive‐out (DIDO) labour system is a long‐distance commuting work arrangement to attract workers towards remote mineral or fossil fuel extraction areas, where they work in shifts and then return to their usual place of residence located in a different region. Along with more and cheaper transportation alternatives, the use of FIFO/DIDO systems have importantly increased in last decades around the world, which has translated to FIFO/DIDO systems operating even when already established cities are present in extractive regions. This paper uses the case of Chile, one of the most important mining countries in the world, to explore whether and in what extent these labor systems influence wage compensations. We find that FIFO/DIDO commuters obtain an average wage compensation of 2.4 per cent per commuted hour.'
