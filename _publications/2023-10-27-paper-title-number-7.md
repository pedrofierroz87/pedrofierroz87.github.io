excerpt: 'This work analyzes the relationship between social media use and the development of internal and external political efficacy, using five 1,650-person polls conducted in 2017â€“2021 in the 10 most populated municipalities of in the Valparaiso Region in Chile, a country characterized by high levels of political discontent and social protests, especially in 2019. With Structural Equation Models, we report positive impacts of different magnitudes of the civic use of social media on internal and external efficacy and no effect of the non-civic use of social media on either type of efficacy. As lower internal and external political efficacy feeds political disaffection, the differentiated use of social media can deepen the gap between engaged and disaffected citizens.'

This study analyzes the National Fund for Regional Development (FNDR), the principal policy for territorial development and compensation in Chile. It identifies three design issues that hinder its purpose. Firstly, it is shown that the distribution criteria result in investment centralization in regions with higher demographic concentration. Secondly, the evidence suggests that the FNDR promotes regional fragmentation, as it increases the relative percentage in the allocation of the original territory following the division of territories. Finally, it is demonstrated that discretion in fund allocation at the intra-regional level generates additional incentives for fragmentation, as it favors distribution in the larger municipalities of each territory. This study offers suggestions for improving the instrument's design to increase its consistency and confront the incentives for territorial fragmentation.
