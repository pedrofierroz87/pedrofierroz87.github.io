excerpt: 'This study analyses the influence of territorial marginalisation in shaping negative political emotions. Focusing on the Chilean Constituent Processes of 2022 and 2023, the research examines two waves of face-to-face surveys conducted in the Chilean region of Valparaíso, with a combined sample size of 3324. The findings reveal that individuals living in urban areas distant from the political centre exhibit markedly negative emotions towards the proceedings of the constitutional conventions. Employing a discrete emotions methodology, the analysis indicates a higher likelihood of intensified feelings of untrust, uncertainty, and confusion among residents of peripheral areas in relation to both constituent processes, the first linked to the left-wing and the second to the right-wing. Therefore, the results make two significant contributions to the field. First, it broadens the scope of research on the geography of discontent, which has traditionally focused on voting patterns, by demonstrating that territorial disparities affect underlying elements such as feelings and attitudes. In a context marked by intense centralisation, this research uniquely highlights territorial division as the sole consistently negative emotive factor throughout both processes, maintaining its significance and direction. Secondly, the study illuminates potential factors shaping public perception during a pivotal societal moment in Chile. This country holds a unique distinction in the global context for having rejected two distinct constitutional proposals via plebiscite, marking an exceptional event in the realms of political transformation and civic participation. Regrettably, territorial context is often overlooked as an influential element in public discourse.'
